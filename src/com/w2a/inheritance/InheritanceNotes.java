	 * 
	 * Execution Flow:
	 * 1. First it will check the method is called using which object
	 * 2. Then it will go to the class
	 * 3. Search for the method
	 * 	if present? execute
	 * 	if not present?
	 * 		check if parent exists?
	 * 			exists? search in parent class
	 * 			else throw error
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Types:
	 * 1. Compile Time/ Static: can be achived by Method Overloading
	 * 2. Run Time/Dynamic: can be achived by Method Overriding
